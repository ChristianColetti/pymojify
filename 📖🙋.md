# 📖🙋 for pymojify

`pymojify` is a lightweight 🛠️ that allows you to run python code written with emojis, reducing 📄 size and increasing 👀ability through 📈ical representation (a 📷 is worth 1000 words, an emoji counts for 100 at least).

📉 character count by 22󠀥󠀥󠀥󠀥 - 56%. This project also comes with an example file 🌳🖨.🐍 which can generate a simple 📄🌳.

## 📦 Overview

This 🛠️ 📖s `.🐍` 📄s, 🏃ing valid `python` code with ASCII-safe 🔎ers like:

```python
def 🌳🖨(...): → def __pymojify_1010____pymojify_1011__(...)
```

## ⚙️ from original `pythonji`

The original code, pythonji, did 🚫 meet the needs and had to be re🛠️d. 
* Inconsistent text encoding imports (needs to be UTF-8️⃣)
* Unknown problems with code parsing
* Needed ability to de🐛

## How to 🏃

`python pymojify.py 🌳🖨.🐍`

Add additional 🚩s `-h` or `--de🐛` if needed. 

`python pymojify.py 🌳🖨.🐍 --de🐛`

`--de🐛` creates a demojified output which can help with de🐛ing.

## 📄s

* pymojify.py - main file to be used to run .🐍 files
* 🌳🖨.🐍 - example file. Builds a 📄🌳 and 🖨s.
